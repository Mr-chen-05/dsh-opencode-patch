/**
 * Remote service for inspecting a local OpenCode installation.
 *
 * Answers the settings card's "check this machine" question: is there an OpenCode
 * credential store here, which account does it belong to, and is it still valid?
 *
 * Two rules shape it, and both are about what must NOT leave the host:
 *
 * 1. **No secret ever crosses the seam.** The answer is a sanitized summary —
 *    email, org, credential kind, expiry — and never the token. The reader it
 *    calls ({@link inspectOpencodeStore}) is built the same way, so there is no
 *    intermediate value to leak.
 * 2. **No machine layout either.** The database path is rewritten to `~`-relative
 *    before it is returned: the card shows WHERE it looked, which is useful, but
 *    a home directory is a fact about this machine and not about the plugin.
 *
 * @module dsh-opencode-patch/opencode-store-service
